## Git Practice Project

This repository was created for my Git and GitHub assignment.

### Files Included
- **index.html** — main HTML page with title, heading, and paragraph.
- **style.css** — enhanced CSS styling with background color, font, and centered text.

### Purpose
This project demonstrates my ability to:
1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Make and commit changes in stages.
3. Push code to GitHub using Git Bash.
4. Write meaningful commit messages.
